## BUG REPORTS

When reporting an issue, ensure to be as clear as possible, and include:

* description of the issue (current behavior, expected/desired behavior)
* minimal steps to reproduce the problem
* motivation and use case for changing the behavior (if relevant)
* version used, and behaviour on older versions (if relevant)

Do note that we can only fix issues happening in the engine or in our own mod. Issues specific to third party mods can't be fixed by us.

## FEATURE REQUESTS

The project has defined [scope](https://github.com/etlegacy/etlegacy/wiki/About) for its goals and ambition.

In case of doubt, you might also want to discuss your idea with us before starting to implement it.
