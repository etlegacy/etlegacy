INTRODUCTION
============

ET: Legacy is an open source project based on the code of Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, which was released in 2010 under
the terms of GPLv3.

Set during World War II and heavily focused on team work, the game was initially released in 2003 by Splash Damage and
id Software. More than a decade after its release, after spending countless hours of escorting tanks and trucks,
stealing gold and radar parts and transmitting confidential documents, it was time to dust off the game which
consistently refused to go down.

Ambition
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two aspects to this project:

* An updated game engine, ET: Legacy, which aims to fix bugs and security exploits, remove old dependencies, add useful
  features and modernize its graphics while still remaining compatible with ET 2.60b and as many of its mods as possible.
* A new mod, Legacy, which aims to add many useful features and improvements while staying close to the original
  gameplay, as well as being lightweight and extensible through Lua scripts.

See https://github.com/etlegacy/etlegacy/wiki/ for more information.


GENERAL NOTES
=============

Game data
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This package release contains only the engine and mod code but not any game data, which is still
covered by the original EULA and must be obeyed as usual. The ET: Legacy installer has downloaded
them for you automatically.

In case you have not used the installer, you can download the free Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory
release from Splash Damage at https://www.splashdamage.com/games/wolfenstein-enemy-territory/.

In order to run ET: Legacy you will need to copy the original assets files
(*pak0.pk3*, *pak1.pk3* and *pak2.pk3*) to the etmain folder.


Compatibility with Enemy Territory 2.60b
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ET: Legacy remains compatible with the ET 2.60b version as much as possible.

Please note that ET: Legacy is *not* compatible with PunkBuster enabled servers. ET: Legacy clients
also cannot connect to servers running the ETPro mod.

See https://github.com/etlegacy/etlegacy/wiki/Compatible-Mods for more information.


Linux 64 bit
------------

Please remember that Linux 64 bit ET: Legacy clients can only connect to servers running mods
providing a 64 bit version. You will be able to play 32 bit-only mods only if you install the
Linux 32 bit version.

At the moment, only the Legacy mod is available in 64 bit version, while all other existing mods
are available in 32 bit only version.
